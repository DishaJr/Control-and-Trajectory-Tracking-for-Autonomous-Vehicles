# Control-and-Trajectory-Tracking-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
## **Task :**
* Build the PID controller object
* PID controller for throttle
* PID controller for steer
* Evaluate the PID efficiency
#
The following video displays the result of implementing the above steps where the car was able to drive through the obstacles placed throughout the street. Understanding the the **P**, **I**, and **D** in **'PID'** allowed the ability to better tune the controller gains.
#
**The values of steering gains :**
* P = 0.5
* I = 0.0005
* D = 0.0007

**The values of throtle gains :**
* P = 0.2
* I = 0.0005
* D = 0.001
